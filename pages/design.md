<h2>Echo watermarking model</h2>
<h5>Our design is an implementation of the echo watermarking technique.The goal of the echo watermarking is to embed the watermark information in the original audio signal resulting in a watermarked audio with a nearly inaudiable watermark. The basic concept behind it is that we introduce a repeated version of a component of the audio signal and manipulating the offset, initial amplitude and decay rate as to produce an imperceptible watermark. </h5>
