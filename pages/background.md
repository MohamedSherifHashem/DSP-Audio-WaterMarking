<h2>How do we judge a watermarking technique? </h2>
<body>The are multiple attributes that we consider when considering a watermarking technique and we need to understand each one of them to be able to judge and choose which technique is more suitable for our purposes.</body>

<h5> -Inaudiability: </h5>
<body>Inadiability is sometimes considered one of the most important attributes of a watermarking technique, it is simply concerned with whether or not your watermark can be detected or heard by the end receiver.But this is not an absolute scale, it depends on the audio quality of the signal and the desired quality of output audio. So for example if the target output quality is low;then the watermark does not have to achieve absolute inadiability and hence giving a little flexability in the design. In summary, it is a balance between the required output quality and the noise that the watermark will introduce, the need for a higher quality will result in the need for the noise introduced by the watermark to be as insignificant as possible. </body>

<h5> -Robustness: </h5>
<body>Robustness is an important aspect in audio watermarking, simply a watermark that is considered robust means that any intentional or unintentional modification or extraction of the watermark is successful if and only if the audio signal get destroyed or loses significant quality.This does not mean that the watermark is impossible to remove or detect it just means that an attempt to remove the watermakr will essentially cauase the destruction of the original audio or render it useless,hence protecting the audio.  </body>

<h5> -Data Rate: </h5>
